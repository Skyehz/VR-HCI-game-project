About The Project
Welcome to our VR project! Using Unity, we're creating an immersive baseball game. Our goal is to blend the excitement of baseball with the immersion of VR. With Unity's tools, we'll craft realistic stadiums, player movements, and gameplay mechanics. Beyond replication, we aim to introduce unique features and interactive elements. Whether you're batting, pitching, or enjoying multiplayer, our game promises an unparalleled VR experience. Join us as we redefine baseball in the virtual world!
